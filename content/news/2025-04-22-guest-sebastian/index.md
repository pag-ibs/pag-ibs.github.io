Dr. Sébastien Lebonnois of Sorbonne Université, France is visiting us for the duration between 13th April and 10th May. 
During his visit he delivered a seminar on understanding the lower atmosphere of Venus. Title of his talk is "Some elements to understand the deep atmosphere of Venus". Dr. Lebonnois studies Venusian deep atmosphere with the help of a general circulation model (GCM) which has been developed at Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique/IPSL. The model might unfold unknown mysteries in the 
deep venusian atmosphere which can be confirmed with the future Venus missions.
