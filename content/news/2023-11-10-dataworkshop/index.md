### We invite you to our third online data workshop. Our workshop introduces how to access publicly available Venus data.

The goals of our data workshops are (1) lowering a barrier for researchers to access recent Venus data and (2) providing chances for students to join internship opportunities in our group, PAG/IBS, Daejeon. Our data workshops are held regularly, 2 times per year (May and November). The materials can be shared with the participants after the workshop upon request.
