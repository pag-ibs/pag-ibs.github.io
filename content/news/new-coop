Good news!
Pioneer Research Center for Climate and Earth Science/PAG and UNIVERSITA’ DEGLI STUDI G. D’ANNUNZIO CHIETI-PESCARA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Annunzio_University_of_Chieti%E2%80%93Pescara) successfully accomplished the agreement of researcher change (and later student exchange - Erasmus Program in Europe).
This is for scientific collaboration between our group and Dr. Lucia MARINANGELI (https://scienze.unich.it/node/8717), who is a planetary geologist (Mars, Venus, Mercury, etc.)
