PAG has collaborated with the staff at the Daejeon Observatory (대전시민천문대) for public outreach activities, and its main telescope of the observatory aims at Venus!

Our second outreach event took place on May 17th at the Daejeon Civil Observatory. Dr. Jose Silva was our enthusiastic guide for the evening and presented celestial objects, including Venus. His presentation was delivered in English, attracting foreign visitors from IBS and expanding the audience base in Daejeon.

Taeho Kim, our intern student, played a crucial role in the communication between the speaker and the observatory team. His contribution helped the event to succeed. 

Thank you for your participation.
