We are excited to announce that IBS signed a contract with a European 
CubeSat company for the CLOVESat-1 flight system. The kick-off date is 
January 10, 2025.
PAG is developing a camera payload to integrate into the CLOVESat-1 
flight system in 2025. PAG plans a series of LEO CubeSats to make 
long-term Venus monitoring over 15 years, and its first CubeSat, 
CLOVESat-1, will be launched in the middle of 2026.
