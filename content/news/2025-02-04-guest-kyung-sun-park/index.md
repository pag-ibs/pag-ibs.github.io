Dr. Kyung-Sun Park from Chung-buk Univ., S. Korea visited PAG and introduced her ongoing research. 
Dr. Kyung-Sun Park talked about the planetary magnetospheric dynamics of different planets like Mars, 
Jupiter and Earth from her simulation results produced in a three dimensional magneto hydrodynamic (MHD) model.
