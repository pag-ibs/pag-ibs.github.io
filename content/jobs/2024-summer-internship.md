### 2024 Summer Internship at the Planetary Atmospheres Group (PAG) in the Institute of Basic Science (IBS) in Daejeon.
We welcome students to explore planetary atmospheric research activities with PAG's members. Undergraduate and graduate school students can apply for the internship project. The initial internship duration is two months during the summer vacation (July and August) and is extendable for up to one year if the project progresses well. For successful candidates, start and end dates can be discussed later with a main supervisor. The working location is PAG/IBS, Daejeon, and a possible remote working schedule can be discussed with the main supervisor of a corresponding topic as long as one satisfies the minimum requirement of two days per week to be at PAG for the group activities in July-August. The monthly salary will depend on the following conditions: the number of days per week to be at PAG and whether you need to pay for the IBS lodge.
