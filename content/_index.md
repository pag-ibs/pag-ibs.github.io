PAG is a planetary atmosphere research group with an emphasis on the atmosphere of Venus. We analyze space- and ground-based observations to better characterize atmospheres on Venus.



With our collaborators, we plan to develop an Earth-orbiting CubeSat mission that will acquire data from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths, which will be compared with ground-based measurements.



When future Venus missions are operational, our Venus monitoring system will provide high-quality time series of the global view over a range of wavelengths.
